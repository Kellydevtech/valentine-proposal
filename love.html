Congratulations 🎉
You just made the best boyfriend in the world very happy.
Officially my Valentine. No refunds. 💖
You didn’t just say yes to being my Valentine…
You said yes to more memories, more laughter, more love.
And I promise to choose you — today and every day after. ❤️
From this moment, you’re not just my Valentine —
you’re my answered prayer, my safe place,
and the best decision my heart ever made. 💕
Thank you for choosing me.
I will never stop choosing you. ❤️
